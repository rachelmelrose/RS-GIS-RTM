RSGISLIB

The remote sensing and GIS software library (RSGISLib) was developed by Peter Bunting and Dan Clewley in the Earth Observation Group
at Aberystwyth University. The software is a collection of tools for processing remote sensing and GIS datasets.

The tools are accessed via an XML interface, enabling batch processing.

The RSGISLIB Wiki has links to documentation and the UserGuide : http://www.rsgislib.org/doku.php
