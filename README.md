RS-GIS-RTM
==========

Remote sensing and GIS code for geoscience applications

CODE:
The subdirectories in this repository are organised by language. They are all part of the head repo, rather than branching,
so one does not have to switch branches to work with different code bases, ie Python or XML etc.


DOCUMENTATION:
I also have a documentation subdirectory that has PDF's of relevant documentation for the code and also workflows I have 
written for specific tasks.
